The platform facilitates connections among users, aiding in the search for potential members and collaborators. Users can create profiles, post content, comment, message each other, and engage with posts. The search feature allows users to find members based on location/distance, instrument, genre, and more. Additionally, the messaging system incorporates a chatbot for interactive site engagement. The project integrates APIs like GraphHopper and OpenAI, and styling is achieved using CSS. Ant Design components are used for modals and dropdown menus.
